## What is attriblink?

Attriblink is a Python package for **attribution linking** in investment performance analysis. It decomposes portfolio returns across multiple periods while preserving additivity, allowing you to understand how different attribution effects contribute to cumulative excess returns over time.

## The Attribution Linking Problem

When analyzing portfolio performance over multiple periods, simply summing period-by-period attribution effects doesn't work due to compounding. Attribution linking solves this by applying sophisticated methods that ensure linked effects:

- Sum exactly to the cumulative excess return
- Preserve the relative importance of each effect
- Account for geometric compounding of returns

## How It Works

The Carino method uses a smoothing coefficient (k-factor) to scale attribution effects:

- **k = 1.0**: No adjustment needed (arithmetic equals geometric)
- **k > 1**: Volatile excess returns — effects scaled up
- **k < 1**: Consistent excess returns — effects scaled down

The sum of linked effects always equals the cumulative excess return, preserving additivity.

## Quick Example

```python
import pandas as pd
from attriblink import link

# Quarterly returns and attribution effects
portfolio_returns = pd.Series([0.025, 0.035, -0.012, 0.048])
benchmark_returns = pd.Series([0.018, 0.028, -0.015, 0.038])

effects = pd.DataFrame({
    "allocation": [0.005, 0.006, 0.002, 0.008],
    "selection": [0.003, 0.002, -0.001, 0.004]
})

# Link effects using Carino method
result = link(effects, portfolio_returns, benchmark_returns)

print(result.summary())
print(f"k-factor: {result.k_factor:.4f}")
```

## Use Cases

Attriblink is designed for:

- **Portfolio Managers**: Understand how allocation and selection decisions contributed to multi-period performance
- **Performance Analysts**: Generate accurate attribution reports across quarters or years
- **Quantitative Researchers**: Validate attribution models and analyze return patterns
- **Risk Teams**: Decompose excess returns to identify sources of outperformance or underperformance
