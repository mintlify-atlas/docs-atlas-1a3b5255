## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Python version too old">
    If you see an error about Python version compatibility, ensure you're using Python 3.10 or higher:
    
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
    
    If your version is older, upgrade Python or use a version manager like `pyenv` or `conda`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pandas or numpy import errors">
    If you encounter import errors for pandas or numpy, ensure they meet minimum version requirements:
    
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pandas>=2.0.0 numpy>=1.26.0
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Installation fails">
